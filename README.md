# auto-backup-gdrive
It's a small script that uploads files using the Google Drive API. Simple, but it saves you from some headaches!

## Instructions:

To use this project, you'll need your own Google Drive API key, which can be easily obtained at: [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/). 

it will be a credentials.json, and you need to place it in the same folder as the main file.
                                                                                                                                            
the requirements.txt file contains the necessary dependencies for the Google library to work.    

## Usage:

python main.py --directory /your/path/folder
